          I'm Javier Codutti, a web developer with 2+ years of experience
          building modern and efficient web applications. I specialize in React,
          Next.js and Astro and enjoy building optimized, scalable and
          well-structured UX/UI web experiences.

          I am passionate about learning new technologies and I am always
          looking to improve my programming skills. I have worked with custom
          authentication using JWT and NextAuth, database integration such as
          MongoDb and developing attractive interfaces focused on an excellent
          user experience.

          One of my most outstanding projects is a Podcast Music, an application
          inspired by YouTube Music that allows smooth playback of podcasts with
          an intuitive design. In addition, I have developed an e-commerce and
          dynamic applications where I have put into practice my knowledge,
          optimizing performance and accessibility.
